# Script Killer


Ever get annoyed by the fact that some sites such as Facebook has over 200 scripts running on the page? Script Killer is a Chrome extension giving you one button in your chrome toolbar that instantly kills all the scripts on the page whether there are 10, 100 or 1000. Simply click the `nojs` icon and you are good to go!
